# Her Vision, Her Voice🌸 

**Her Vision, Her Voice** is a purpose-driven initiative by me to support and inspire children from rural areas through education, creativity, and kindness. This project is not just a website — it's a heartfelt movement to amplify voices, spark learning, and share hope through storytelling, tech, and compassion.
